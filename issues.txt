issues:

1) better error-reporting. Start with pattern-matching on the instruction list to make sure everything is valid (i.e. that comparison operators have values after them, that 'if' statements are followed by comparisons, etc.

2) get multiple lines to work when there are comments on each line

3) include line number information in tokens, not just character information

4) disallow recursion (if the stack already contains a pointer, do not allow it to be pushed again).
